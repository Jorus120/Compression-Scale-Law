# Compression-Scale-Law
A lightweight method to flag hidden structure and instability in time series.  CSL compares how well real data compresses against null surrogates (or uses a simple variance-ratio proxy) across different window sizes. If the data is consistently more compressible than chance, the slope of that scaling gives an index (Î±) of hidden order.
