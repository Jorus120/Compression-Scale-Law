# Contributing (Compact)

This repo is intentionally small. Please keep contributions minimal and practical:

- **No heavy dependencies**; avoid large frameworks.
- **No large datasets**; link to sources or use tiny examples.
- **Keep examples short**; <50 lines per recipe if possible.
- Issues welcome for: clarifications, typos, missing steps, or small doc improvements.
